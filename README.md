The BMI Measurement Machine project aims to measure weight and height for people with
the ability to keep a diet chart. Here, we use an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor that uses gold to
determine the height distance of an object and a weight scale sensor that can convert weight
into an equivalent electrical signal. This sensor is called a load cell, so in this project, we will
use four load cells with the capacity to measure up to 50 kg as our Arduino weight sensor.
Through this project people will be able to diagnose his BMI and see the smart diet chat for
him which will help a person to lead a healthy life.
